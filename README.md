# 💼 My Real Projects Portfolio

This repository contains all my **main and important Python projects**, carefully organized into categories that reflect my growing skills in areas like **data visualization**, **game development**, and more.

I use this as my core portfolio to track and showcase the best work I've done so far.

## 📊 Data Visualization Projects

Located in `data_visualization_project/`, this folder includes all major projects where I’ve used Python libraries like:

- **Matplotlib**
- **Plotly Express**
- **Seaborn**
- **Pandas**

These projects show my ability to analyze and present data in meaningful, interactive, and insightful ways.

### Example Projects:
- `covid19_visualizer/`: Live and interactive data plots of COVID-19 cases globally.
- `weather_trends_dashboard/`: Multi-line and bar plots for climate trends using real-world data.

## 🎮 Pygame Projects

Located in `pygame_project/`, this folder contains the games I’ve created using **Pygame**. These projects reflect my understanding of game loops, collision detection, object-oriented design, and interactive interfaces.

### Notable Games:
- `alien_invasion/`: A side-scrolling alien shooter where enemies move toward a stationary rocket.
- `snake_game/`: A classic Snake game (currently improving with better visuals, high score logic, and levels).
